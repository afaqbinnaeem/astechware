              There are four main factors that you need to keep in mind whenever you finalize a software company:

            <h2>1. Cost-Effectiveness:</h2>
            <p>
              Within the world of software companies, two types of paradigms exist one is of the well-known software houses which have multiple clients and have huge staff support and the number of projects is higher than their available resources. However, on the other side startups exists in which both staff and projects are limited assuring that if the staff is dedicated and skilled the project would be according to expectations. But the difference that exists between both the companies is those big software companies require big budgets and because their staff is involved in multiple projects the deadlines are not met effectively whereas, in the case of a startup, the end product received is cost-effective because the startups have lesser budget requirements as well as tend to meet the deadlines because they have lesser projects to focus on.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Niche:</h2>

            <p>
              This factor plays a pivotal role in helping you decide on the software company that you think can understand your business or need appropriately. It is extremely important to hire a company that has a previous experience in that specific field similar to the client’s business. This would help the client gain confidence that the company understands all the services their business provides and would integrate all the modules appropriately. An example of this is that a finance-related company or a bank should hire a software company that is based on Fin-Tech rather than a company that handles android or ios development.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Punctuality:</h2>
            <p>
              The pressure of work makes it difficult for software houses to meet their deadlines. However, the client after signing the agreement starts to count every possible day awaiting their product, not realizing that their product might not be the priority project for the software company. Hence it is essential to always find a company that would treat your project as a priority project and meets all the committed deadlines. It is essential that once a deadline has been met the client is communicated that the project has reached a certain stage. This could be achieved effectively if the company dedicates a different team to every project. The reason behind this is to ensure that the team is focused on their project only and all the efforts are dedicated to meeting the deadline. This would be beneficial for both the client and the software company.
            </p>
            <h2>4. Scope:</h2>
            <p>
              It is extremely important to understand your own project before you hand it over to a software company and for that, you don’t necessarily have to have a four-year-long degree in CS but a simple google search could aid you in the best possible way. Google search would make it easier for you to profile the companies you have shortlisted so far by understanding which company’s domain coincides with the needs of your project. The first step is to search whether a web-based application or a mobile-based application would be more efficient for your business and that precisely depends on the nature of the project and its scope. Once that has been narrowed down you could have a more effective discussion regarding the framework that would make your software more efficient.
            </p>

            <h2>ProTip:</h2>
            <p>
             This information would assist you in the search for which framework and language would work best for your desired software. An example of this is that Java is used if banking or enterprise software is to be created but other companies which are web-based would prefer frameworks such as Ruby on Rails or Node JS for back-end and for front-end development, Angular or React would be a good choice. However, for mobile-based applications, React Native should suit them best. All these frameworks have their own pros and cons and for the client to take better decisions all this information would not only help in making a good decision but protect the client from any sort of fraud.

              I’m not saying life is over after fifty. If you so desire, there’s not much you can’t do if you want to badly enough. You’re not too old for most activities, 
              but you’re not quite as spry as you once were; things stop operating as efficiently, nothing bends like it used to, and you begin to atrophy just a bit. You start
              to feel the effects of gravity. You do not bounce.
